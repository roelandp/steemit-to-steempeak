# Steemit to Steempeak Chrome extension

This is a very simple url redirector Chrome extension which "onBeforeRequest" changes any urls pointing to steemit.com to steempeak.com.

Since both sites have the same url structure you should end up at the same content.

## How to add to Chrome

1. Git clone this repository to your local environment or download
2. Open Chrome.
3. Launch Extensions via Menu
4. Enable "developer" mode
5. Click "Load Unpacked"
6. Navigate to the folder of this downloaded project
7. Add & voila!
